Revision history for IOD

0.9.1    2014-08-13 (SHARYANTO)

         - Use JSON rule for double-quoted string (in key value as well as
           directive argument), this way we don't have to define our own string
           rule.

         - Introduce key value encoding. This is the more extensible way.
           Currently known encodings: !j (!json), !e (!expr), !base64, !h
           (!hex).

         - Remove !defaults directive, its function can be replaced by !merge.

         - Remove mode merging for now.

         - !merge can merge multiple sections.

         - Expression is left undefined for now, no longer defined as using the
           Xslate/Kolon syntax. Change syntax of expression to use value
           encoding.

         - Add TODO section.

         - Remove mention of nested section. Implementation is now left to do it
           (or not).

         - Remove encoding/quoting in section name and key name for now.

         - Remove !sectionpath and !nosectionpath for now.

         - Other tweaks.


0.9.0    2012-10-14 (SHARYANTO)

         - First release. Split from implementation Config-Ini-OnDrugs.

         - Some rewording and reorganization.

         - Change nested section syntax, from using indented section line to
           using [foo/bar], in an effort to prevent users getting confused with
           significant indentation.

         - Expression now uses Text::Xslate::Syntax::Kolon instead of
           Language::Expr (probably temporary? due to slow implementation of
           Language::Expr).

         - Add directives: !sectionpath, !no{merge,defaults,sectionpath}

         - Now only one argument is allowed for !defaults.

         - Some rewording and reorganization.
