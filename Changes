Revision history for IOD

0.9.0    2012-10-14 (SHARYANTO)

         First release. Split from implementation Config-Ini-OnDrugs.

         - Some rewording and reorganization.

         - Change nested section syntax, from using indented section line to
           using [foo/bar], in an effort to prevent users getting confused with
           significant indentation.

         - Expression now uses Text::Xslate::Syntax::Kolon instead of
           Language::Expr (probably temporary? due to slow implementation of
           Language::Expr).

         - Add directives: !sectionpath, !no{merge,defaults,sectionpath}

         - Now only one argument is allowed for !defaults.

         - Some rewording and reorganization.
