Revision history for IOD

0.9.0    2012-10-13 (SHARYANTO)

         First release. Split from Config-Ini-OnDrugs.

         - Change nested section syntax, from using indented section line to
           using [foo/bar] (or [/foo]), [./foo], and [../foo], in an effort to
           prevent users getting confused with significant indentation.
